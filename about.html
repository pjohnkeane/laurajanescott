<p>My work explores the balance between positive and negative space, presence and absence.&nbsp;</p><p>Each series of work has it's own mathematical grid and, as such, is an exploration of the combinations and compositions that can be made within set parameters.</p><p>I am very interested in the idea of art as work. Art as a problem that can be worked through systematically. A process that continues to present a challenge and that can occupy a lifetime,&nbsp;</p><p>The ultimate goal, the most favourable result in the eyes of the artist and the viewer, is subjective and can never be defined, but the work, the art, is in the trying, the exploring and the constant refinement.&nbsp;<br></p>
